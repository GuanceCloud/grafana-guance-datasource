Visualize your [Guance](https://www.guance.com/) metrics within Grafana. 

## Installation

For more information, visit the docs on [plugin installation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/plugin-management).

## Configuration

Configure the data source with the Endpint and API Key, and save the data source.

The Endpint can be found [here](https://docs.guance.com/en/open-api/#support-endpoint).

API Key can be found as "API Key ID", and generated at *[Guance](https://www.guance.com/)* > *Management* > *Api Key* > *Key ID*.

Now you can configure a panel within [DQL](https://docs.guance.com/en/dql/define/) on your dashboard.
